A friend, business woman, approached me with a request to make her a website
business card for her company and help with hosting. After calling and discussing the project with her, I designed and implemented a working adaptive-size website, using tools such as ReactJS, expressJS, NodeJS (css & html obviosly). Them we chatted, she did correctives into design, and had finished result.
